### 🎥🔍 RAG-based Video QA System 🤖
Interact with videos like never before! 🚀 This Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) project enables users to ask questions from video content and get AI-generated answers. Perfect for analyzing long video content without manual watching!

### ⚙️ How It Works
📤 Video Upload: User uploads video files.
✂️ Transcript Extraction: Audio is extracted and transcribed into text.
🧠 Embedding Generation: Splits text into chunks and creates embeddings.
🗄️ PostgreSQL Storage: Embeddings stored in PostgreSQL for efficient retrieval.
💬 Question Answering: Retrieve relevant data and generate answers using LLM.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
Python 🐍
HTML, CSS, JS 🎨💻
PostgreSQL 🐘 for embeddings.
LangChain 🦜🔗 for RAG pipeline.
LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, Llama 2) for answering.
Speech-to-text API (e.g., Whisper, Google STT).

## ✨ Features
✅ Ask questions directly from video content.
✅ Accurate retrieval from transcribed data.
✅ Beautiful frontend interface (HTML/CSS/JS).
✅ Fast response with stored embeddings.
